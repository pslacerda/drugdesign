time execution. 
Run analysis_main.py file for obtaing the analysis

Three files will be build. See below their details.

* all_docking_time.txt
In this file is stored time of each docking. 
Here, it is sorted by docking time.

* vs_energies_sorted.txt
In this file is stored all energies of each docking. 
Here, it is sorted by docking energy.

* vs_energy_histogram.xvg
In this file contains the energy frequency.
Use plot_energy_histogram.py file to plot it.
